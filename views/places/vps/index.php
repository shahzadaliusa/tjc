                            an animal hunter born in Kumaun. Sir Johns Hewett, Lt Governer of United Provices, at the suggestion of James Corbett
                            decided to establish a wildlife park. On 8<sup>th</sup> August, 1936, the park opened and named as Hailey National Park
                            on the name of Sir Malcom Hailey. Later it changed to Ramganga National Park and finally in 1952, it is named as 
                            Corbett National Park in honour and the memory of Late Jim Corbett.
